# Inclusivity
## This exercise is a skills challenge in Python from Data in Motion. Thanks to Kedeisha Bryan for the fun weekly challenges.

1. What is the distribution of inclusivity ratings among campuses? What can you infer about the general level of inclusivity across campuses?
   
Campuses are generally rated as more inclusive than not, with the distribution of ratings highest from rank 4 and above.

2. Is there a correlation between the number of students at a campus and its inclusivity rating? Do larger campuses tend to have higher or lower ratings?

There is not true correlation between the number of students and the rating. You could say there is a positive correlation, but there are small campuses with high ratings and it would appear the cause of the ratings could be tied more closely to other things. Larger campuses do tend to have higher ratings with those that have more than 20,000 students not scoring below a 3.5.

3. How does the community type affect the inclusivity rating of a campus? Compare the inclusivity ratings across different community types (e.g., large urban city, medium city, very small town, rural community).

The community type does seem to influence the rating some as well. The larger the community the higher the rating is likely to be. The data does not state what the exact parameters are to consider a community small, medium or large, or what the difference is between a small and very small town. The small towns have the greatest number of reporting campuses.

4. Which campuses are the outliers in terms of their inclusivity rating? Identify campuses that have significantly higher or lower inclusivity ratings compared to others in similar community types or with similar student populations. What characteristics or factors might explain these outliers?

5. What recommendations can you provide to campuses with lower inclusivity ratings based on the characteristics of high-rating campuses? Analyze the common characteristics of campuses with high inclusivity ratings and suggest actionable strategies for campuses with lower ratings to improve their inclusivity. Consider factors such as campus location, community type, and size in your recommendations.

Generally, campuses located in more metropolitan areas with more students tend to be more diverse and rural areas less so. The campuses with the lowest ratings though include mosting junior colleges, community colleges or trade schools. Campuses that affer a more traditional campus immersive experience are likely more aware and prioritize DEI more so than trade schools. 

### Further Research 
If I were to research further I would include some data to compare inclusivity rating in areas of different political and religious affiliations.
